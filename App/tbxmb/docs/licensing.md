# Dual licensing model

By default, MicroTBX-Modbus is licensed under version 3 of the GNU GPL (**GPLv3**). Thanks to the GPLv3, MicroTBX-Modbus can be released with full source code and is perfect for these use cases:

* Evaluation, education, prototyping, hobbying and inclusion in other open source projects.

The GPLv3 licensed version of MicroTBX-Modbus is **not suitable** for these use cases:

* Inclusion in closed source proprietary firmware.

To circumvent the restrictions and responsibilities that come with the GPLv3, your company can purchase a commercially licensed version of MicroTBX-Modbus. With your commercially licensed version of MicroTBX-Modbus, you can include and make use of this software in your closed source proprietary firmware.

## Why a dual licensing model?

The development and maintenance, needed to make available a stable, high quality and open source embedded software component, takes significant engineering time and effort. From experience with the [OpenBLT bootloader](https://github.com/feaser/openblt), Feaser learned that relying solely on donations is unfortunately not a viable and sustainable option. The dual licensing model offers the best of both worlds, making it a win-win scenario for all its users:

* It makes it possible for MicroTBX-Modbus to be available to everyone as open source.
* The income generated from the commercial license sales enables Feaser to sponsor the long-term development and maintenance of MicroTBX-Modbus.

## Licensing frequently asked questions

<u>What happens if I do include the GPLv3 version of MicroTBX-Modbus in my own software?</u>

As long as you do not distribute your software to someone else, nothing really happens. However, the moment you either give or sell your software or a product containing your software, you are required to open source the source code of your entire software. The GPLv3 is infectious; any code that uses GPLv3 software, automatically becomes GPLv3 as well.

<u>Are there any differences between the GPLv3 and commercially licensed versions of MicroTBX-Modbus?</u>

The only changes are the license text in the license file and the license information in the source files. The actual API and functionality of MicroTBX-Modbus is exactly the same.

<u>What are the restrictions of the MicroTBX-Modbus commercial license?</u>

The only real restriction of the commercial license is that you cannot redistribute your commercially licensed version of MicroTBX-Modbus to third parties in source code format (including your customers and users). Binary format (object-code or executable) is of course allowed. Feel free to [contact Feaser](mailto:sales@feaser.com?subject=License%20sample%20request%20for%20MicroTBX-Modbus) to request a sample of the commercial license for you to review.

<u>How can I obtain pricing information for the commercial license for MicroTBX-Modbus?</u>
